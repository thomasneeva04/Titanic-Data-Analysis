# 🚢 Titanic Data Wrangling and Analysis

**Author:** Neeva K Thomas  
**Project:** Week 10 — Data Wrangling and Preparation  
**Dataset Source:** Titanic Dataset  
**Language:** Python  

## Overview
This mini-project focuses on cleaning, preprocessing, and analyzing the Titanic dataset. It includes data importing, missing value handling, feature engineering, encoding, scaling, pivot tables, and visualizations.

## Features of Data Wrangling Performed
- Missing Age values filled with median
- Embarked missing entries dropped
- Categorical encoding for Sex and Embarked
- Standardization & normalization of numerical features
- Removal of irrelevant columns
- (optional) additional feature engineering

## 📊 Visualizations
- Survival count
- Survival by sex
- Survival by class
- Age distribution
- Fare distribution

## Key Insights
- Females survived at a much higher rate than males
- First-class passengers had significantly better survival chances
- Younger passengers were more likely to survive
- Higher fares correlate with higher survival probability

## Files Included
- `Titanic_Data_Wrangling_and_Analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing code & analysis  
- `titanic_cleaned.csv` — cleaned and processed dataset
